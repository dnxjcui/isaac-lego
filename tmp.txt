point_box mention="The first image"> (138,0) (729,945) </point_box> shows a hand holding the green bamboo-like structure. <point_box mention="In the second and third images"> (236,0) (729,945) </point_box>, we see the same structure on a circular base with gray stones around it. The piece in question is likely part of this decorative element. Based on its position in these images, I would place this piece at the top right corner where the hand is holding it, as that's where it appears to be currently positioned according to the instructions shown. This placement aligns with how the structure should be assembled based on the visual cues from the instruction manual pages.
